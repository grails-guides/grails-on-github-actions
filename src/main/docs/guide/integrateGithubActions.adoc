To setup Github Actions, create a file:

[source,yaml]
----
#.github/workflows/gradle.yml
include::{sourceDir}/../.github/workflows/gradle.yml[]
----

<1> Run Github action for pushes to branch `master`.
<2> Run Github action for pull requests targeting branch `master`.
<3> Run Github action for JDK 8 and 11
<4> GitHub cache Action allows caching dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time.
<5> Run tests

When you push the code to Github you will see the Grails tests run with both JDK 8 and JDK 11.
