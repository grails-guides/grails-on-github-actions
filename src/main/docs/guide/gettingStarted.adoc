Every software project needs https://circleci.com/continuous-integration/[Continuous Integration (CI)].

[quote, Circle CI Docs]
Continuous integration is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while
ensuring the quality of the code. Developers continually commit small increments of code (at least daily, or even
several times a day), which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository.

Circle CI is a continuous integration platform seamlessly integrated with https://github.com/features#documentation[GitHub].  It supports your development process by automatically
building, testing and deploying code changes.

In this guide you are going to create a Grails application on GitHub and use https://circleci.com/[Circle CI] to build
and test your code. This guide assumes you are familiar with Git and GitHub. It also assumes that you already have a GitHub account.
The guide will cover only build and test an Grails application with Circle CI.  However, Circle CI has the https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/test/[ability to deploy, send notifications, and
highly customize CI jobs].

Circle has one free plan for any project, and has progressively more costly plans for higher needs. Thus, it is really convenient
to build and test an open source Grails Plugin which you may wish to contribute to the community.
